# Feature Specification: Care Coordination Dashboard

## User Story

**As a** Midwife (provider),
**I want to** have a comprehensive dashboard that consolidates patient information, care plans, appointment schedules, alerts, and communication tools,
**so that** I can efficiently manage my caseload, track patient progress, coordinate care actions, and improve continuity of care with higher job satisfaction.

## Feature Description

The Care Coordination Dashboard is a centralized interface designed for midwives that consolidates all critical patient and care management data in an intuitive, customizable layout. It presents real-time updates on patient health metrics, appointment statuses, alerts for high-risk cases, upcoming tasks, and recent communications. The dashboard supports patient grouping and tagging for segmented care, provides analytics on workload and care outcomes, and facilitates easy handoffs between care providers. Features include interactive charts, task lists, alert prioritization, document access, and messaging integration. The dashboard aims to reduce administrative overhead, improve care coordination, and enhance midwife job satisfaction through streamlined workflows and continuous care models.

Key capabilities:

- Data aggregation from multiple sources into unified patient profiles
- Real-time alerts and prioritized task notifications
- Visual analytics of caseload distribution, risk stratification, and outcome trends
- Patient grouping, tagging, and filtering for efficient case management
- Seamless communication tools embedded within the dashboard
- Secure document access and upload for care coordination
- Customizable UI with drag-and-drop widgets to tailor workflows
- Audit trails and compliance monitoring features
- Integration with appointment scheduling, health tracking, and educational resources
- Support for multi-provider handoffs and shared care plans


## Acceptance Criteria

### Given–When–Then Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Midwife accesses comprehensive dashboard**

- **Given** a midwife is logged in
- **When** they navigate to the care coordination dashboard
- **Then** they see all assigned patients with up-to-date summaries
- **And** alerts for urgent cases are prominently displayed
- **And** relevant tasks and communications are accessible

**Scenario 2: Midwife uses patient grouping and tagging**

- **Given** many patients with varying risk levels
- **When** the midwife applies tags or groups to patients (e.g., high-risk, postpartum)
- **Then** the dashboard dynamically updates to display filtered views
- **And** workflows adjust to prioritize these groups accordingly

**Scenario 3: Midwife receives alert and acts**

- **Given** a patient triggers a health alert
- **When** the alert appears in the dashboard
- **Then** the midwife can see details, communicate instantly, and document actions taken
- **And** the alert is logged for compliance

**Scenario 4: Midwife reviews performance analytics**

- **Given** daily or weekly workload
- **When** the midwife views analytics widgets
- **Then** they receive insights on patient outcomes, visit adherence, and workload balance
- **And** can export reports for review


### Bullet Point Criteria

- Dashboard loads data efficiently with near real-time updates
- Alerts are actionable and linked to patient records
- Patient list supports sorting, searching, filtering, and tagging
- Widgets support customization and drag-and-drop rearrangement
- Communication tools integrate secure messaging and quick actions
- Document and care plan management accessible via dashboard
- Audit logs record all care coordination actions
- Compliance monitoring and reminders integrated
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop use
- Role-based access controls enforce security and privacy
- Integration with backend services for appointments, health tracking, education
