# Feature Specification: Essential Health Tracking

## User Story

**As a** Patient (expecting mother),
**I want to** track my vital health parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, sleep, physical activity, and fetal movements in real time,
**so that** I can monitor my pregnancy health closely and prevent complications that could lead to hospital readmissions.

**As a** Provider (midwife),
**I want to** have access to continuous, real-time health tracking data from my patients,
**so that** I can make timely clinical decisions and intervene early to reduce maternal and fetal health risks.

**As a** Family Member,
**I want to** be able to view relevant health data of the expecting mother (with consent),
**so that** I can support and assist her by understanding her health condition and alerting if anything seems abnormal.

## Feature Description

The Essential Health Tracking feature enables continuous, real-time monitoring of key maternal and fetal health metrics, including but not limited to maternal heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), blood pressure, fetal heart rate (FHR), uterine contractions, sleep quality, physical activity, and maternal body position. Data is collected via mobile devices or integrated wearable sensors, securely transmitted to the backend, and presented to users through intuitive dashboards. Advanced processing algorithms provide automated alerts for abnormal values and trends, enabling early detection of potential complications. Paired with AI capabilities, the system supports personalized health insights and predictive analytics to reduce hospital readmissions by an estimated 30%. The solution is designed for usability across low- and high-resource settings with configurable monitoring parameters.

Key capabilities include:

- Continuous, non-invasive vital signs monitoring compatible with common wearables and mobile devices
- Real-time data transmission and secure storage with encryption
- Personalized health dashboards for patients, providers, and authorized family members
- AI-supported anomaly detection and early warning notifications
- Historical trend visualization and data export for clinical review
- Configurable alert thresholds and notification preferences
- Integration ability with external sensor platforms and health records
- Data privacy and role-based access control compliant with healthcare regulations


## Acceptance Criteria

### Given–When–Then Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Patient uploads continuous health data**

- **Given** a patient is wearing a compatible wearable device or submits health data through the app
- **When** new health data is collected
- **Then** the system securely transmits and stores the data in real time
- **And** the patient’s health dashboard updates with latest readings

**Scenario 2: Provider reviews patient health status**

- **Given** a provider logs into the system and selects a patient
- **When** the provider accesses the health tracking dashboard
- **Then** the provider sees up-to-date vital sign trends, alerts, and historical data
- **And** can export data or flag concerns for follow-up

**Scenario 3: System detects abnormal vital signs**

- **Given** continuous incoming health data
- **When** values exceed configured thresholds (e.g., tachycardia, hypoxia)
- **Then** the system triggers automated alerts to patient, provider, and optionally family members
- **And** logs the incident for clinical review

**Scenario 4: Family member accesses patient data with consent**

- **Given** family member access is granted by the patient
- **When** the family member views the app
- **Then** they can see summary health status and alerts without viewing sensitive clinical details


### Bullet Point Criteria

- System supports real-time streaming and batch upload of health parameters
- Data encryption in transit and at rest using AES-256 and TLS
- Vital signs tracked include: heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, fetal heart rate, uterine contractions, sleep metrics, physical activity
- AI-powered anomaly detection with customizable alert thresholds
- Health data must be displayed graphically with trends over time
- Role-based access control limits data visibility appropriately
- Manual data entry supported in absence of wearables with input validation
- System maintains at least 6 months of patient health data
- Notifications sent via SMS, email, and in-app push
- Data export in CSV and PDF formats for clinical consultation
- System interoperable with third-party sensor APIs (Bluetooth, IoT)
- Offline data caching and progressive sync when connection resumes
- API rate limiting and audit logging enabled
