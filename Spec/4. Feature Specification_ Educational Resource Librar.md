# Feature Specification: Educational Resource Library

## User Story

**As a** Patient (expecting mother),
**I want to** access reliable, evidence-based educational materials about pregnancy, childbirth, newborn care, breastfeeding, and postpartum health,
**so that** I can make informed decisions and feel empowered throughout my pregnancy and early parenthood.

**As a** Provider (midwife),
**I want to** curate, share, and recommend educational resources tailored to each patient's needs and pregnancy stage,
**so that** I can support health education seamlessly and enhance patient understanding and outcomes.

**As a** Family Member,
**I want to** access approved educational content about supporting the expecting mother and newborn,
**so that** I can contribute meaningfully to care and family well-being.

## Feature Description

The Educational Resource Library is a digital repository integrated into the application where midwives and healthcare providers can upload, curate, and organize multimedia educational materials — including articles, videos, brochures, FAQs, and interactive modules. Content is categorized by pregnancy stage, topic (nutrition, mental health, breastfeeding, etc.), and user role accessibility. Providers can assign resources directly to patients or patient groups to support personalized education. The system supports search, bookmarking, and progress tracking, enhancing the learning experience. Content is evidence-based and regularly updated according to current healthcare guidelines and culturally sensitive practices. Additionally, the platform includes feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement of educational offerings.

Key capabilities include:

- Multimedia content support (PDF, video, audio, text)
- Comprehensive categorization and tagging system
- Personalized content assignment based on patient profile and pregnancy stage
- Searchable library with filters for topic, format, and user role
- Progress tracking and bookmarking for patients and families
- Provider dashboard for content management and recommendations
- Secure content access respecting privacy and copyright rules
- Notifications for new or recommended resources
- Feedback and rating system for users to rate content relevance and clarity


## Acceptance Criteria

### Given–When–Then Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Patient accesses educational materials**

- **Given** a patient is logged into the app
- **When** they navigate to the Resource Library
- **Then** they can browse categorized materials by pregnancy stage and topic
- **And** access multimedia content seamlessly

**Scenario 2: Provider assigns resources**

- **Given** a provider is logged in with appropriate permissions
- **When** they select a patient and assign one or more educational resources
- **Then** the patient receives a notification
- **And** assigned resources appear in patient's personalized library

**Scenario 3: Family member views accessible content**

- **Given** family member access is granted by the patient
- **When** a family member logs in and visits the Resource Library
- **Then** they can view approved materials appropriate for their role

**Scenario 4: User searches for content**

- **Given** a logged-in user accesses the library
- **When** they enter search keywords or apply filters
- **Then** the system returns relevant, ranked content quickly

**Scenario 5: Patient tracks learning progress**

- **Given** a patient interacts with educational content
- **When** they mark content as read or complete interactive modules
- **Then** the system updates their progress and provides completion status


### Bullet Point Criteria

- Library must support upload and rendering of text, PDF, video, and audio formats
- Content must be categorized with tags, pregnancy stages, and user roles (patient, provider, family)
- Role-based content access control with per-resource permissions
- Searchable with keyword and filter options
- Providers can assign and recommend resources to specific patients or groups
- Notifications triggered on assignment or content updates
- User feedback/ratings recorded for continuous improvement
- Progress tracking saved per user and content item
- Mobile-friendly interface with offline caching for downloaded content
- Content import/export via CSV or JSON for bulk updates
- Secure content storage preventing unauthorized access or sharing
