# Feature Specification: Automated Appointment Scheduling

## User Story

**As a** Patient (expecting mother), **I want to** easily book, reschedule, and receive automated reminders for my appointments with my midwife, **so that** I never miss important prenatal visits and can manage my schedule effectively.

**As a** Provider (midwife), **I want to** have an automated scheduling system that manages appointments, sends reminders, and handles rescheduling requests, **so that** I can reduce administrative workload by 30% and focus more time on patient care.

**As a** Family Member, **I want to** view upcoming appointments and receive reminders for my partner's prenatal visits, **so that** I can provide support and attend important appointments when needed.

## Feature Description

The Automated Appointment Scheduling system provides comprehensive appointment management with n8n workflow automation integration. The platform enables patients to book available time slots, automatically sends multi-channel reminders (SMS, email, push notifications), handles rescheduling requests, and manages waitlists. The system integrates with provider calendars, tracks appointment history, and provides analytics on no-show patterns and optimal scheduling times.

Key capabilities include:

- Real-time availability checking with provider calendar synchronization
- Multi-step automated reminder workflows (72 hours, 24 hours, 2 hours before)
- Intelligent rescheduling with conflict detection and waitlist management
- Automated no-show tracking and follow-up workflows
- Recurring appointment scheduling for regular prenatal visits
- Provider schedule optimization based on historical data
- Emergency appointment booking with priority queuing
- Integration with external calendar systems (Google Calendar, Outlook)
- Automated appointment confirmation and preparation instructions
- Analytics dashboard for appointment patterns and optimization


## Acceptance Criteria

### Given-When-Then Format:

**Scenario 1: Patient books new appointment**

- **Given** a patient is logged in and has an assigned provider
- **When** they select an available time slot and confirm booking
- **Then** the appointment is created in the database
- **And** the provider's calendar is updated automatically
- **And** a confirmation message is sent to the patient
- **And** automated reminder workflows are triggered in n8n

**Scenario 2: Automated reminder system**

- **Given** an appointment is scheduled for tomorrow
- **When** the 24-hour reminder trigger activates
- **Then** the patient receives SMS, email, and push notifications
- **And** family members with consent receive notifications
- **And** the reminder status is logged in the system

**Scenario 3: Patient reschedules appointment**

- **Given** a patient has an upcoming appointment
- **When** they request to reschedule to a different available slot
- **Then** the old appointment is cancelled
- **And** the new appointment is confirmed
- **And** all parties receive updated notifications
- **And** the provider's calendar reflects the changes

**Scenario 4: No-show handling**

- **Given** a patient fails to attend a scheduled appointment
- **When** the appointment time passes without check-in
- **Then** the appointment is marked as no-show
- **And** automated follow-up workflow is triggered
- **And** the time slot becomes available for other patients


### Bullet Point Criteria:

- System must check real-time provider availability before allowing bookings
- Appointments must support different types: Regular checkup, Emergency, Follow-up, Group session
- Reminder system must use multiple channels with user preference settings
- Rescheduling must validate provider availability and prevent double-booking
- System must maintain appointment history for continuity of care
- Waitlist functionality must automatically offer cancelled slots to waiting patients
- Emergency appointments must override regular scheduling rules
- Provider must be able to block time slots for personal time/breaks
- System must generate appointment analytics for providers
- All scheduling actions must create audit trails
- Timezone handling for multi-location providers
- Integration with existing healthcare scheduling systems via APIs

    - Conditions: Check if appointment still active, user preferences
2. **No-Show Follow-up Workflow**
    - Trigger: 15 minutes after appointment time
    - Actions: Mark as no-show → Send follow-up message → Offer rescheduling → Update analytics
3. **Waitlist Notification Workflow**
    - Trigger: Appointment cancellation
    - Actions: Check waitlist → Notify eligible patients → Auto-book if confirmed within 30 minutes
4. **Provider Schedule Optimization Workflow**
    - Trigger: Weekly schedule analysis
    - Actions: Analyze booking patterns → Suggest optimal time slots → Generate efficiency reports

### Security \& Authorization

**Requirements:**
