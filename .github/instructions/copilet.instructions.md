# Project structure

- The client app is built using ReactJs and communicates with the .NET backend via RESTful APIs.
- Client app is located in the ClientApp directory.
- The server app is built using ASP.NET Core and serves the API endpoints.
- The database is managed using Entity Framework Core with a PostgreSQL backend.
- The application uses JWT authentication for secure API access.
- Server app is located in the ServerApp directory.

# Requirements

- You are building this application for a 4 hour hackathon, where we have to come up with a working prototype that demonstrates the core functionality of the application .
- Generated requirements/specs are in the `Spec` directory.
- ClientApp's boilerplate code is set up with necessary dependencies and folder structure.
    - But make sure the reloads are working correctly, when refreshed using public/_redirects file
- ServerApp's boilerplate code is set up with necessary dependencies and folder structure.
- When creating a feature make sure create both client and server side implementations.
    - Use consistent naming conventions and folder structures across both apps.

# General Guidelines
- For all methods add a doc comment describing the purpose and behavior.
- Keep the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by extracting reusable logic into separate functions or components.
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and components to improve readability.
- All generated code should have appropriate error handling.
- All generated code should be annotated with comments explaining the logic and purpose (you may use inline comments to cover 2-3 lines at once, rather than adding comments for each line).
    - Add "Generated by Copilot with date and time" to the top of each generated file.
- Be mindful of potential security implications when using AI-generated code.

# Error Handling & Fallbacks
- Validate code for syntax errors after implementing it.

# Evaluation & Feedback Loops
- After generating code:
    - Do a quick self-check (e.g., linting, typing, or running available unit tests).

# Assets
- Check `Assets` folder for logos and other visual elements.

# IMPORTANT
- Always review generated code before using it in the project.
- Always ask questions if you're unsure about something. If a request is unclear, ask for clarification instead of guessing
- *Append to this instructions file as you learn new things about the project.*
- After each feature implementation, add an entry to the changelog, detailing the changes made and any relevant context.
